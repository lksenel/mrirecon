# mrirecon 

This repository contains the codes and demos for the techniques developed at ICON Lab @ Bilkent University.
These are mainly the methods we develop for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging.

You are encouraged to modify/distribute the code. However, please acknowledge this code and cite the corresponding papers appropriately.

# ReCaT

This is the code and demos for [the following paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.26902): 

Biyik E, Ilicak E, Çukur T. Reconstruction by calibration over tensors for multi-coil multi-acquisition balanced SSFP imaging. Magn Reson Med 2017. doi: 10.1002/mrm.26902.

This code utilizes and requires SPIRiT library and TensorLab package.

## Demos

```matlab
	demo_ReCat.m : Demonstrates the LSQR implementation of ReCat.

	demo_MLCC.m  : Demonstrates multi-linear coil compression in comparison to geometric decomposition coil compression (Zhang et. al, "Coil Compression for Accelerated Imaging with Cartesian Sampling").
```
